# MY/Mine/Meine Introduction

Greetings to the flesh upon souls who read this.

I shall bestow my introduction upon you so thou can know myself. I, the heir of the failure throne, the master of the proscrastinating stone, and the collector of depressed bones, am ***Ateeb***.

**Ateeb**. Yeah, that's what they call me. They think they know me. They think they know my name, my self, my identity. They think they know everything. But only I know who I am; an impetuous, impregnable, and impeccable being. I'm an idea, and ideas are bulletproof.
